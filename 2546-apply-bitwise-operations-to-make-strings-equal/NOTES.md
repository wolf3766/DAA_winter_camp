1. problem can be broken to two simple parts,convert every incorrect zero to one and every incorrect one to zero
2. a zero can be converted to 1, simple if anywhere a one is present in a string
3. a one can be converted to 0, if we have a one in the string
4. now, when can we not convert, when there is no one, but we are asked to produce a one in that case only the answer is false
